# NSA Codebreaker Challenge 2025 Writeup
![My solver badge](Images/solver_badge.png)

This repository contains my writeup for the 2025 NSA Codebreaker Challenge, a multi-month technical challenge designed to simulate real-world security analysis and investigative problem-solving. 

Running from September 24th, 2025 to January 14th, 2026, the challenge consisted of seven sequential tasks requiring independent analysis of unfamiliar artifacts, rapid acquisition of tools, and clear technical documentation. 

I began the challenge on release and completed all seven tasks by December 22nd, 2025. This writeup highlights my analytical approach, technical decision-making, and security-focused methodologies across the full challenge.

## How to Read This Repository
This repository is structured as a series of investigative writeups rather than a single linear project. Each task represents an independent technical challenge and highlights a different area of cybersecurity.

Each task writeup is self-contained and can be read independently. The emphasis throughout is on analytical process, decision-making, and clear technical documentation, rather than simply arriving at a final answer. This repository is intended to demonstrate real-world security investigation and tradeoffs rather than polished tooling or production-ready code.
